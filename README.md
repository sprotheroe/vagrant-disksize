# vagrant-disksize

A Vagrant plugin to resize disks in VirtualBox


## Installation


```shell
vagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize
```

## Usage

Set the size you want for your disk in your Vagrantfile. For example

```ruby
Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
  config.vm.box = 'ubuntu/xenial64'
  config.disksize.size = '50GB'
end
```

You can specify the size as a raw number (in bytes) or using KB, MB, GB
or TB (though I'd be interested to learn more if you are using Vagrant
to create multi-terabyte disks). Internally the size will be converted
to megabytes, for ease of interaction with VirtualBox. If the value you
specify isn't a whole number of megabytes, it will be rounded up, to
ensure you have at least the capacity you requested. Note that the
plugin uses the original definitions so, for example, 1 GB = 1024 MB;
we don't have to use hardware manufacturer marketing maths here and
it makes the internal maths easier.

## Limitations

At present only the first disk will be resized. That seems to be OK for
typical boxes such as the official Ubuntu images for Xenial, but there may
well be other configurations where the first disk found isn't the main HDD.

The plugin only works with VirtualBox but it will issue an error message
and then disable itself if you try to use it with another provider.

Disks can only be increased in size. There is no facility to shrink a disk.

This hasn't been tested on a wide variety of versions of Vagrant or VirtualBox.
It works for, at least, Vagrant 1.8.5 and VirtualBox 5.1.x, but any
feedback about other versions, particularly older ones, would be much appreciated.

### Additional steps

Depending on the guest, you may need to resize the partition and the filesystem
from within the guest. At present the plugin only resizes the underlying disk.

To adapt the filesystem of a logical volume located at `/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00` inside `/dev/sda3` follow these steps:

```sh
# 1. Install Dependencies
sudo yum install -y cloud-utils-growpart xfsprogs

# 2. Extend device partition
sudo growpart /dev/sda 3

# 3. Extend physical volume
sudo pvresize /dev/sda3

# 4. Extend logical volume
sudo lvextend -l+100%FREE /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00

# 5. Extend file system
sudo xfs_growfs -d /


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
